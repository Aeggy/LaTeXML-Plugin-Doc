Current working order is: 
get .tex file: file.tex
Then: 
latexmlc file.tex --destination=file.ltxml --post
xsltproc --output=document.xml ltx2word.xsl file.ltxml 
xsltproc --output=document.xml.rels relations.xsl document.xml
Run latexml on .bib file , use bibliographies.xsl on that to create item1.xml, sort that into CustomXML
Apply stylesheet to document.xml to get rid of stupid leftovers (also indent it nicely). 
Move pictures (if present) into media folder (subfolder of word). 
Then move into appropriate file system (Currently in testing ground) (document.xml into word, document.xml.rels into word/rels) and zip (not tar.gz) it into file.zip
Then rename to file.docx. 
If you want to print out a bibliography at the end, insert it manually with Editor of choice (don't have this working yet, will have to see if it works when it is done. ) 
Voila! Done with that part
