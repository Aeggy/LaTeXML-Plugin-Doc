Mandy Simons: "Presuppositions without Common Ground":

p.8: "I have argued that there is a strong case to be made that presuppositionality ... is the result of conversational inferences ... inferences about what?"

p.9: "But the standard view on presupposition is that presupposition
triggers provide the interpreter not just with information about the
speaker things, but with information what the speaker thinks the
*common ground* is like." 

"Stalnaker ... defines presuppositionality directly in terms of
constraints on speaker beliefs." 

p.10: Problem of the common ground view with "I want to call my
sister" if hearer doesn't know about the existence of the sister.
p.11: Put common ground constraint as part of the conventional content
of the utterance: it cannot be inferred.

p.14: Presupposition without common ground:
cooperation in communication: cooperative speaker + cooperative hearer

p.16: "Required background assumptions, like presuppositions, must be
non-controverial; a controversial background implicature may induce a
``presupposition denail'' response." ... "presuppositions may be
either old or new information; but if it is new information, then, if
the conversation is to proceed entirely smoothly, it should be
uncontroversial."

p.19: "Utterance presupposition:
p is a presupposition of an utterance U iff:
 (i)  It is not part of the speaker's primary communicative intention 
      to convey p and
 (ii) the interpreter of U must take the speaker of U to accept p in order
      to make sense of U."
